# CosmteicnCarnetManager
Program to managing small local databases for carnets and cosmetics

IMPORTANT!
Run this program only if that program path is a currently working directory.
Normally that program have installer - it was made for friend to help him in his job ;) - and program path was predifined.
However, you can feel free to change the APP_PATH in config.py -after this program directory ommit last '/'- and also replace self.buffPath to APP_PATH in BackupManager class - there are three repetitions of that call.

Program generate logs and clean them if there are to big.
zipnunzip.py works like module for app.py, so that i put there also small documentations of functions I'd made.
I hope you find this program interesting and useful.
